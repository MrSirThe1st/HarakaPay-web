Style

The design should feel enterprise-grade, minimal, trustworthy, and futuristic, with a strong grid layout, lots of whitespace, modern sans-serif typography, and abstract data-inspired graphics. Use gradients, geometric shapes, and subtle animations instead of stock photos. Prioritize clarity and scalability (for complex product ecosystems). Always communicate authority and innovation without overwhelming the user with visuals.
